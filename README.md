Exploring Role Identification and Evolution based on Propagation Dynamics across Multi-chain Systems within the Crypto Gambling Ecosystem

Abstract:
With advances in blockchain technology, crypto gambling has gained popularity relative to traditional gambling due to its perceived transparency, which is attributed to the utilization of smart contracts. However, beneath this fa√ßade of transparency conceals a reality that the operation of these crypto casinos is controlled by behind-the-scenes roles. These roles, hidden amongst the players, remain elusive and challenging to identify for authorities and players. Moreover, the increasingly decentralized nature of crypto casinos has catalyzed a shift and evolution in the roles and behaviors of these concealed participants. In this paper, we first systematically focus on the identification of key and hidden participant roles, as well as their evolution within the crypto gambling ecosystem. We propose a novel graph-based framework that combines a node centrality method based on propagation probability dynamics and hierarchical clustering based on feature-level fusion to map crypto addresses into potential roles. Experiments on real cases of Ethereum, TRON, and Arbitrum blockchain platforms demonstrate that our proposed approach not only identifies fundamental roles but also uncovers diverse delegatees across different stages. In the initial stages, airdrop promoters, listing agents, and arbitrageurs are involved while there is an emergence of bonus payers, fund sponsors, disguised gamblers, cross-chain bridges, and service providers in later stages. Remarkably, our results achieve a higher match with identities confirmed by judicial authorities than existing methods, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in crypto gambling scenarios.
